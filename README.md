# lunar-logic


lunar-logic is an innovative coding project that aims to create a circular logic game and visualization tool. This unique tool operates with prompts driven by different logical option gates, forming a flow chart that flows in circles. The purpose of this tool is to help users identify and point out erroneous logic, reasoning, hypocrisy, and repetitive explanations that lead to circular arguments. 

It serves as a playful and informative way to address logical fallacies and circular reasoning encountered in various discussions, debates, or everyday situations.


Key Features:
1. Circular Logic Game: lunar-logic offers a game-like interface where users can navigate through circular logic scenarios to recognize and address flawed reasoning.
2. Visualization of Flows: The tool visually represents the circular logic flow using circular charts, making it easier for users to comprehend the circularity in arguments.
3. Logical Option Gates: The program incorporates logical option gates, presenting users with different choices that lead to circular reasoning or erroneous conclusions.
4. Error Highlighting: When users encounter a circular argument, the tool highlights the logical error and provides explanations to promote understanding.
5. Hypocrisy Recognition: lunar-logic includes prompts that expose hypocrisy in reasoning, enabling users to notice inconsistencies in arguments.
6. Learning Resource: The tool can serve as an educational resource to enhance critical thinking and logical reasoning skills.


Best Coding Languages:

JavaScript is the best coding language for this project. JavaScript allows for interactive web-based visualizations and can be used for creating the circular flow charts and user interface.

HTML and CSS will be used to structure the web-based interface and provide styling for a visually appealing experience.


Basic Workflow:
1. Circular Logic Scenario Generation: Define a set of circular logic scenarios and prompts, each representing a different logical fallacy or circular argument.
2. Circular Flow Chart Visualization: Develop a circular flow chart visualization that represents the logic flow and options for each scenario.
3. User Interaction: Implement user interactions, allowing users to navigate through the circular flow chart by making choices at each logical option gate.
4. Error Detection: The program will detect circular reasoning or flawed logic when users select certain options and highlight the errors.
5. Explanations and Learning Resources: Provide informative explanations for each circular scenario to help users understand the logical errors and learn from them.
6. User Feedback: Implement user feedback mechanisms to allow users to provide comments or suggest additional circular logic scenarios.


Basic I/O Details:

lunar-logic will be a web-based tool, and users will interact with it through a browser. The circular flow chart and logical option gates will be displayed on the interface, and users will make choices by clicking on the appropriate options.

When users encounter circular reasoning or flawed logic, the tool will provide feedback and highlight the errors, explaining the issues in a user-friendly manner.


The tool will not require user registration or store personal information, as it aims to be a simple and accessible educational resource for analyzing circular arguments and logical fallacies.
