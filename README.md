Inspired by my horrid ex-boyfriend.

No kidding.

But, this is a circular logic game/visualization tool with prompts operated by different logical option gates. Imagine a flow chart, but it flows in circles. It just keeps going in circles. 

Use this shit to point out erroneous logic/reasoning, hypocrisy, and for when you're just too damn tired of explaining the same things over and over again to no avail.
